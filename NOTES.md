## Variables and Data Structures

### New variable declaration

#### let

`let` is scoped to the block, unlike `var` which is scoped to the
function. Block scoping narrows the availability of variables and makes
them easier to manage.

`let` solves a common problem involving `var` and closures that often
causes undesired behavior:

    var ary = [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ];
    for ( var i = 0; i < ary.length; i++ ) {

            setTimeout(
                function () {
                    console.log( i );
                },
                1000 * i
            );

    }

If I run this, every alert will be 3, because by the time the alerts are
run, that is the value of `i`.

The previous way to fix this was to wrap the inner part of the loop in
another function (often called an "Immediately-Invoked Function
Expression" or IIFE):

    var ary = [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ];
    for ( var i = 0; i < ary.length; i++ ) {
        (function ( i ) {
            setTimeout(
                function () {
                    console.log( i );
                },
                1000 * i
            );
        })( i ); // pass in the loop var to avoid closure problem
    }

If instead I use `let`, I will get the behavior I expect without jumping
through syntactic hoops.

    var ary = [ 0, 1, 2, 3 ];
    for ( let i = 0; i < ary.length; i++ ) {

            setTimeout(
                function () {
                    console.log( i );
                },
                1000 * i
            );

    }

Now each alert is the current value of the loop iterator.

#### const

True constants are something JavaScript has never had, but now it does.
`const` follows the same block scoping rules as `let`.

Like read-only variables in Perl, this doesn't prevent you from changing
things inside a constant array or constant object (for that, we can use
`Object.freeze()`).

#### Template literals

JavaScript now has string interpolation. So, instead of having to
concatenate variables with strings using `+`:

    var name = "Doug";
    console.log( "Hello, " + name );

We can now use `\`\`` and `${ ... }` to interpolate the variable into
the string:

    var name = "Doug";
    var hello = `Hello, ${name}`;

The thing inside the `${...}` can be any expression, like a math
expression:

    console.log( `2Ï€ = ${ Math.PI * 2 }` );

(Also, JavaScript now supports Unicode better)

#### Object shorthand

If we're building an object from scratch using `{ ... }`, now we have
a few shortcuts that make it less typing.

##### Named functions

If we're adding a function to an object, we don't need to say its name
twice, and we don't even need to explicitly use the `function` keyword.

Where previously we had to write this:

    var calc = {
        add: function add( x, y ) { return x+y }
    };

Now we can write this:

    var calc = {
                      add( x, y ) { return x+y }
    };

##### Member variables

If we're adding some local variables as new members to our object, we
also don't need to say their names twice.

    var   PI = 3.1415925;
    var   E = 2.71623;
    var numbers = {
        PI: PI,
        E:  E
    };

Now becomes:

    const PI = 3.1415925;
    const E = 2.71623;
    let numbers = {
            PI,
            E
    };

These two features combine to make objects less typing:

    var Math = {
        add: function add( x, y ) { return x + y },
        PI: PI,
        E:  E
    };

    let Math = {
                      add( x, y ) { return x+y }
            PI,
            E
    };

#### Destructuring

Destructuring allows you to reduce the number of steps to get at the
important things inside arrays and objects.

So, if you have a function that returns an array, and you only want the
first two things:

    let ary = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
    let [ first, second ] = ary;

    console.log( first );
    console.log( second );

But even more fun is destructuring objects, which allows us to quickly
grab all the interesting properties out of an object.

    const FOO = Math.PI, BAR = Math.E;
    const { "PI": FOO, "E": BAR } = Math;

This saves the constant `Math.PI` to the local `const FOO`, and `Math.E`
to the local `const BAR`.

#### Iterables

JavaScript now has an Iterable interface, and a new loop construct:
`for..of`. This, unlike `for..in`, works like most other languages'
loops when using an array.

`for..in` loops over property names. This mostly works fine for arrays:
the only "properties" one sets on an array are numeric. But if someone
adds a named property to the array, it will show up in every single
`for..in` loop.

    let ary = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
    ary.foo = "bar"; // Arrays are objects and can have properties
    for ( let i in ary ) {
        console.log( i );
    }

    1
    2
    3
    4
    foo // ???

The `for..of` construct is explicitly, for arrays, only looping over the
indexes:

    let ary = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];
    ary.foo = "bar"; // Arrays are objects and can have properties
    for ( let i of ary ) {
        console.log( i );
    }

    1
    2
    3
    4

## Functions and Arguments

### Generators

Along with the new `for..of` iterator loop, we have generator functions.
These functions produce a new item for an iterator every time they are
called.

### Default Param Values

Now we can more easily have default parameters in our functions:

XXX Old way?

    function pow( x, y=1 ) {
        return Math.pow( x, y );
    }

### Spread Operator (...)

When you want to apply an array as the arguments to a function, you no
longer have to call `Function.apply`. Just use the `...` spread
operator:

    function add( x, y ) {
        return x + y;
    }
    let nums = [ 1, 2 ];

    console.log( add.apply(    nums ) );


    function add( x, y ) {
        return x + y;
    }
    let nums = [ 1, 2 ];

    console.log( add      ( ...nums ) );

### Rest Operator

If we want our function to have a variable number of arguments, we can
add the `...` to its parameter list, which will put the remaining
arguments into an array we name.

Previously, we had to use the `arguments` pseudo-array (and I won't get
in to the full implications of that "pseudo" there):

    function sum( ) {
        var sum = 0;
        for ( var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++ ) {
            sum += arguments[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

This makes it more difficult when you've got some required arguments and
other optional arguments.

### Arrow Functions

This is my favorite thing in new JavaScript, and not just because
there's less typing. JavaScript is massively callback-oriented:
Everything async requires at least one callback. Often, in a series of
async operations, you have callbacks calling callbacks calling
callbacks. It gets to be a lot of small, anonymous functions.

Arrow functions make callbacks a lot easier:

    var add = function ( x, y ) { return x + y };

    let add =          ( x, y ) =>       x + y;

We don't need the word `function`, we don't need the curly braces,
because it's a single expression, and we don't need `return`!

#### Arrow Function Binding

But the best part is that arrow functions do not affect the context
of the code. `this` is still the same as it was when the callback was
created. This prevents us from having to save our scope variable to some
other variable like `self` or `that`:

    var self = this;
    this.addEventListener( 'click', function () {
        console.log( 'clicked once, removing...' );
        self.removeEventListener( 'click' );
    } );

    this.addEventListener( 'click',          () => {
        console.log( 'clicked once, removing...' );
        this.removeEventListener( 'click' );
    } );

This pattern is such a huge source of headaches for new JS users that
I'm infinitely glad that there is finally a better way.

### Promises

Promises are another way to make callbacks easier to deal with,
especially for async requests that have a single response:

    function get( url, cb ) {
        var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

        request.addEventListener( 'load', function () {
            cb.call        ( this.responseText );
        } );
        request.open( "GET", url );
        request.send();

    }

    // Fetch three things in order
    get( 'http://example.com', function ( response ) {
        get( 'http://example.net', function ( response ) {
            get( 'http://example.org', function ( response ) {
                console.log( 'Done!' );
            } );
        } );
    } );

    function get( url     ) {
        var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
        var promise = new Promise();
        request.addEventListener( 'load', function () {
            promise.resolve( this.responseText );
        } );
        request.open( "GET", url );
        request.send();
        return promise;
    }

    // Fetch three things in order
    get( 'http://example.com' )
        .then( () => get( 'http://example.net' ) )
        .then( () => get( 'http://example.org' ) );

Promises encapsulate a request and hold on to the response (the
resolution). Order doesn't matter, which fixes another common misstep by
novice async programmers:

    var request = new XMLHttpRequest();

    request.open( "GET", url );
    request.send();

    request.addEventListener( 'load', function () { /* ... */ } );

Here, it is possible that the `send()` finishes immediately, and the
`load` event gets fired _before we added our listener!_ With Promise,
calling `then()` after the promise has been resolved results in the same
behavior, just a little faster:

    var promise = new Promise();
    promise.then( ( response ) => console.log( response ) );
    promise.resolve( "response" );


    var promise = new Promise();

    promise.resolve( "response" );
    promise.then( ( response ) => console.log( response ) );

## Objects

JavaScript objects are unique. But now we've got some much-needed
features that make them more functional and easier to use for those
schooled in `class`ic OO programming.

proxy objects
Subclass built-ins like Array, Date, and Element
classes
modules

## How to use ES6 now

The JavaScript ecosystem has some tools that will let us use ES6
features in web browsers that do not yet support ES6 natively!

For this, we need to install `nodejs` and `npm`. I'll leave that up to
you, Your Milage May Vary based on your OS. For me, it was pretty easy
as I use Homebrew for OSX and just did `brew install nodejs npm`

Then I needed to configure `npm` to install `babel` and `browserify`.

Babel is the ES6 to ES5 compiler system. It's much, much more than that,
too much more than that, but that is what we're using it for. This gets
us our ES6 syntaxes.

Browserify is how we get our ES5 from Babel to work in a browser. This
includes combining all of our individual modules into one file, and sets
up the right functions for loading them so that it all comes together
and works as we expect.

So, first we need to define our project in a file called `project.json`:

    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }

Then we can install babel and our dependencies and tell npm to update
our package.json for us:

    $ npm install --save-dev babel-cli babelify browserify

Once these are installed, npm will add them to our package.json:

    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "devDependencies": {
        "babel-cli": "^6.0.0",
        "babelify": "^7.3.0",
        "browserify": "^13.1.1"
      }
    }

By default, babel does nothing. To make it do something, we need to
configure it, and install more plugins. The easiest thing to do is to
install the `latest` bundle. And we'll need the `polyfill` to ensure
proper support of Promises and other expected functions.

    $ npm install --save-dev babel-polyfill babel-preset-latest

Finally, we need a way to make ES6 modules work. Since there are lots of
ways, we'll install the one that babeljs recommends as a default,
CommonJS:

    $ npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs

Now with all our stuff installed, we can configure babel using a file
called `.babelrc`:

    {
        "presets": ["latest"],
        "plugins": ["transform-es2015-modules-commonjs"]
    }

We'll put all our source code in a "src/" directory, and then
compile our software using browserify:

    $ browserify src/* -o app.js -t [ babelify ]

This creates a file called "app.js" in our root directory that we can
load in our web browser!

To make this a bit easier, we can create an `npm script` that will build
our software by adding this section to our `package.json`.

    "scripts": {
        "build": "browserify src/* -o app.js -t [ babelify ]"
    },

Now we can run `npm run build` to build our software.
